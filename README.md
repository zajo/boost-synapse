Synapse is a non-intrusive C++ signal programming library. Features:

* Register connections and emit signals from any C or C++ object of any type whatsoever.

* If two contexts share access to a C or C++ object, they can use that object as a rendezvous point, and communicate with each other through Synapse signals.

* A system of meta signals provides interoperability with other signal programming libraries and callback APIs.

* In a multi-thread environment signals can be emitted asynchronously and scheduled for synchronous execution when polled in other threads.
